BEER PROCEDURES
Know Your Beer
Being able to point folks in the right direction when they’re hunting for a good beer can make the difference between a run-of-the-mill bartender and some of the best. You don’t have to know everything, but being able to speak intelligently about what’s on the board will help. If you see something on the wall you don’t know, grab a sample and give it a shot. 

Here are a few notes that might help: 
Lagers
Lagers are usually brewed at lower temperatures than other beers (because the yeast used in lagers allows it). Lagers tend to be crisp, light, and refreshing. They’re easy to drink and are often associated with classic beers. 
Pale Lager - Crisp, light-bodies, and moderately hoppy. 
Pilsner - Hoppy and pale gold in color, this beer originates from 19th-century Europe and is a mainstay on most menus. 
Amber or Red Lager - Uses malted barley for the extra color and toasty flavor. 
Dark Lager - Dark and complex yet still light and refreshing. 
Ales
Ales are made from yeast strains that prefer warmer temperatures--often around room temperature. Ales come in a wide variety. 
Kolsch - Pale, light-bodied ale that’s very similar to a lager. 
Pale Ale - American pale ales have a hoppy bite with citrus notes. English styles can be malty while Belgian-style pale ales are more balanced and less hoppy. 
Amber and Red Ales - Ales with notes of dried fruit, caramel, and even coffee. Darker in color. 
India Pale Ale (IPA) - Extra strong and hoppy, often very bitter. IPA’s are very rarely subtle and can be quite dank. 
Dark Ale - Often malty or fruity, these ales can have notes of baked apple or raisin. 
Brown Ale - Often English-style. Nutty and dark. 
Wheat Ale - Ale brewed with wheat--hefeweizens fall in this category. Often has notes of banana or cotton candy. 
Belgian - Belgian-style ales vary widely. Just know: Belgium has the beer game nailed. You can’t go wrong here. 
Stouts and Porters 
Stouts and porters are intensely dark beers. While technically ales, these beers deserve their own category due to their unique flavor and profile. 
Oatmeal stouts and porters - Made with oatmeal, these beers have a silky texture and are rich, dark, and thick. 
Imperial stouts and porters - Chocolatey, heavy, and strong. 
Special Beers
While not distinct styles, these beers are worth knowing and sharing. 
Fruit Beer - A beer brewed with fruit. 
Farmhouse - Rustic and refreshing beer brewed with wild yeast
Radler - Beer with added fruit or citrus juice
Light Beer - Beer with low ABV that’s easy to drink (often low calorie as well) 
Sour - More of a flavor profile. These beers are tart and--well--sour. 
How to Pour Beer
Samples
Rinse the sample glass.
Pour as little as possible straight from the faucet. Do not pre-pour any beer to clear foam, foam is perfectly acceptable in your sample. 1 oz of beer is the ideal sample size. If they order the beer after tasting, you’ll already have the faucet cleared for the full pour.

Important note: clearing the faucet is done only to reduce excess foam on a full pour when the faucet hasn’t been used in the past 5+ minutes. When the faucet has been sitting for a while, the first 1-2 oz of beer will be warmer than the rest of the line, generating more foam than desired, but it will still taste fine for a sample. But if you’ve poured a sample or just finished a pour, the faucet does not need to be cleared again.
10 oz Pours
Rinse the 10oz-er– try to make sure all of the inside surface gets wet
Angle the glass to 45 degrees and place it as close to the faucet as possible without touching it. Touching the glass to the faucet will cause the faucet to become dirty quickly and will negatively affect the pour.
Quickly open the faucet to the 100% open position. Partially opening the faucet will cause excessive foaming.
Keep the glass angled until it reaches 75% of your target fill line. At that point straighten the glass and pour straight down the middle until it reaches your target fill line. As a reference, we will provide a snifter/wine glass with demarcations at the various pour sizes (e.g. a 5 oz. wine pour is at the bottom of the text/logo on the wine glasses). 
Shut the faucet completely. 
Allow the foam room to expand after pouring if any overflow occurs, rinse the exterior of the glass and wipe it dry.
Nonic Pints
Rinse the Nonic – try to make sure all of the inside surface gets wet
If you haven’t poured the beer that was ordered recently, open the faucet completely and let the first 0.5 oz. land in the drip tray to clear the warm beer from inside the faucet. This will help minimize foam in the glass. Note: Always open the faucet 100%. Partially opening the faucet will cause excessive foaming.
Angle the glass to 45 degrees and place it in the beer stream as close to the faucet as possible without touching it. Touching the glass to the faucet will cause the faucet to become dirty quickly and will negatively affect the pour.
Keep the glass angled until the glass is 75% full. At that point straighten the glass and pour straight down the middle until it is 90% full.
Shut the faucet completely when the glass reaches 90% full. This will allow the foam room to expand after pouring is done without spilling. 
Allow the foam room to expand after pouring if any overflow occurs, rinse the exterior of the glass and wipe it dry.
Cleaning Beer Lines
Double check that the tiles, labels & register are updated to reflect the floated keg.
Open and fill the “clean rinse” jug with cold water and toss ‘er in the walk-in after you close it up.
Open and fill the “cleaning solution” jug and fill ‘er with hot water. Mix in 1.5 ounces of cleaning solution for every gallon of water in the jug. A full jug is 4.25 gallons.
Tap the line(s) to be cleaned onto the cleaning jug and make sure the little red gas valves are on. Run the cleaning solution through all lines to be cleaned.
After the cleaning solution is tapped, unhook that there jug and empty it in the dump sink.
Hook up the rinse jug just like the cleaning solution jug and run clean rinse water through at a ratio of 2:1 with the cleaning solution. Basically, run twice as much rinse water through as cleaning solution.
Once the rinse water has been run through, please empty the jug and store it back where it goes.
After the line is rinsed, go ahead and tap the next keg on the list. 
What to Do When a Beer Kicks:
When a beer kicks, there may just be a backup back there. Here’s the best workflow to ensure that the beer continues to flow: 
When a beer kicks, unhook the keg and place the empty keg with the other empties in the shop. 
Drop the name of the keg in the #86 Slack channel and pull down the keg tile from the wall. 
For mainstays, there may be another keg of the same beer in the walkin. If so, place it back on the same line. 
For rotating lines, look for a matching ribbon on another keg. It’ll be labeled with the draft line it should be put on. 
If the keg that is going on is similar enough to the one that just kicked, just put the keg on. 
If the new keg is a different style, you’ll need to clean the draft lines before putting it on. Follow the procedure above. 
Make a new tile (unless one has already been made). 
If the new beer isn’t in the POS yet, drop a message in the #86ed Slack channel requesting one and use a similar beer temporarily. 
Repairs and Maintenance
The “Old Perlick” faucets have rounded edges, a smaller “P” engraved on the face of the faucet and a much smaller compression bonnet. They look like this:


There are two main types of leaks we see with our faucets, those that flow up through the top of the faucet by the handle and those that flow through the bottom of the faucet. I’ll break them down under this handy diagram of our standard faucets. Here’s a list of the parts:
2. Standard O-ring
3. Floating O-ring
4. Coupling Gasket
5. Handle Lever
6. Bearing Cup
7. Compression Bonnet
8. Handle Jacket


For Top-Flowing Leaks: 
Uncouple the keg that is tapped on the leaking line to keep our precious beer from spraying all over the place.
Remove the tap handle first and set it aside.
Grab one of the clean pickle/jalapeno/jam/syrup tubs and fill it halfway up with warm water. You’ll use this to keep track of all the little pieces during the repair.
Unscrew the handle jacket (8) and place it in the tub.
Unscrew the compression bonnet (7) and place it in the tub.
Inspect the o-ring (2) on the top of the bearing cup (6) to see if it is misshapen. If it is deformed, grab a replacement from the beer toolkit so you can replace it after you check the rest of the components.
Pull the handle lever (5) and bearing cup (6) from the faucet body, separate them and place them in the tub as well.
Inspect the o-ring (2) that is seated inside the top opening on the faucet. If it is deformed, grab a replacement from the beer toolkit so you can replace it after you check the rest of the components.
If necessary, replace the o-ring (2) mentioned in Step 8.
Place the bearing cup (6) back on the handle lever (5) with the opening facing the back of the faucet.
Place the new or undamaged o-ring (2) on top of the bearing cup.
Make sure that the bearing cup is aligned inside of the tabs on the top of the opening in the faucet and replace the compression bonnet (7).
Replace the handle jacket (8) and the tap handle.
Replace the coupler on the keg and check to see if the fix has worked.
For Bottom-Flowing Leaks:
Unfortunately, this process starts by performing steps 1 – 8 of the top-flowing leak procedure.
Grab a faucet wrench and turn the collar at the back of the faucet clockwise to remove the faucet from the shank.

Rinse the faucet in your tub o’ hot water and get a faucet brush from the beer tool kit. Brush out the faucet thoroughly. 
Use the brush to displace the floating o-ring (3) from the faucet body and inspect the ring for damage. If damaged, replace it with one of the spares that are in the crate by the walk-in door.
Make sure that the coupling gasket is in place and reattach the faucet to the shank with the faucet wrench.
Resume steps 9-14 of the top-leaking process to finalize the repair.
