Dialing In Espresso 

1. Pull a dumpster shot to warm the machine up. 
2. Pull a second shot and check your parameters: 
    - Dose Going In - 18-19 grams
    - Time to Brew - 24-30 seconds
3. Weight of Finished Shot - 40-50 grams
4. If you’re not right where you need to be and it doesn’t taste nice, make adjustments. 
    - Adjust dose first. It’s the easiest. 
5. If you still can’t get there, adjust the grind setting slightly and purge the grinder.
6. Use your guidelines as a rule of thumb and dial in by taste.
