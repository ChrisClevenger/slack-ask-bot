Step 1: Clock Out of the Shared POS Profile (4444)
By clocking out, Shift Review automatically begins. Note: This should only be done at the end of the day after all sales have been completed. 

Step 2: Close Out All Open Taps

In the Close checks step, select the Close checks button. This opens the Payment Terminal screen. From the Payment Terminal screen, you can close your open and unpaid checks. Changes made to the checks are automatically reflected in the Close checks step.
For Open checks with a credit card saved, process the payment on the card and add 20% gratuity. 
For open checks without a credit card saved, comp out each item using discounts. 
For employee tabs without a credit card, comp out each item and drop a reminder to the employee in Slack. 
After all the checks have been closed, you return back to the Shift Review screen. The Close checks step displays a green checkmark and the following information is updated:
Number of open checks
Number of paid checks
Number of closed checks
Select the Next button to continue to the next part of Shift Review. 
Step 3: Declare Cash Tips

Count cash tips left in the tip jar or in the drawer and input the total amount using the numerical keypad. 
Select the Declare button to declare your cash tips, or select the No tips button to declare no tips and close out of the keypad and return to the Shift Review screen. After you declare your cash tips, the Declare cash tips step displays the total amount of declared cash tips and a green checkmark.

Exchange smaller bills for larger ones in the cash drawer. 
Place cash tips in an envelope for later deposit. 
Step 3: Reconcile Cash and Close Drawer

Count the cash in the drawer. Ensure that the drawer is left with the appropriate amount ($250). 
Use the prompts to input the correct amounts in the appropriate boxes. 
Place Cash sales in an envelope along with Cash tips.
