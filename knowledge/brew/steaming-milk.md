Steaming Milk / Latte Art / How to Steam Milk

MILK PREPARATION
Start with clean, dry pitcher. 
Fill to appropriate level with milk (one finger width from bottom, below spout). 
Purge steam wand. 
Place steam wand tip into surface of milk, off to slight angle. 
Aerate (incorporate air) until until milk reaches temperature of your palm, or pitcher no longer feels cold. 
Submerge wand just below surface of milk. 
Heat until uncomfortably hot to touch, around 145°. 
Clean & purge wand with milk-designated towel.

Steamed milk should:
Have tiniest bubbles possible, “microfoam”
Be between 140–150°
Maintain a glossy appearance, like wet paint
Retain sweetness, while being too hot to immediately consume

Milk Preparation Mistakes and Corrections:
Poor Milk Texture
Aerating too late (missing lipid conversion), Aerate asap.
Over steaming (burning of fats), Stop steaming before it burns your hand.
Tapping the pitcher excessively (tap tap swirl), couple taps and a swirl is sufficient.
Waiting too long (milk foam separation), pour asap after tap and swirl.
Fast/Slow Flowrate
Too fast (release foam early, sinks), moderate flowrate.
Too Slow (foam stays inside the pitcher), maintain enough flow rate.	
Spout Proximity
Dropping in too far back (art gets stuck in bottom), push art forward from top.
Angle too great (pour close to reduce angle), wait till later to tilt pitcher aggressively.
Milk Portion
Too Much Milk (ratio to get pitcher closer), aim for ⅔ of pitcher volume.
Beige and low contrast (angle the pitcher), increase angle as pour progresses.
Pulling Back
Moving Backwards (should always push), start at back of cup and push forward.
Oblong Shapes (push to wrap design), pushing helps stay symmetrical.
Claw Gripping
Creates favored side (level pouring is perpendicular), relax your hand when pouring.
One side wraps higher (avoid favoring your body when pouring), stay centered.
Holding Cup at angle (film at front to identify angles), use a mirror or camera.
Cup Rotation
Pour stuck in top half (rotate cup for design to move forward), adjust angle along with pitcher.
Not rotating enough (velocity from rotation carries design forward), don’t be afraid to rotate.
Rippling Overkill
Makes erratic design (controllable speed will still create ripples), keep it simple first.
Doesn’t push foam (slow down for foam to leave pitcher), gentle transition let gravity do the work.
Fit Too Much
Doesn’t wrap art (reduce final pour amount to retain base dimensions), less is more.
Too much stacking and beige (keep simple to maintain clarity), the goal is contrast.
