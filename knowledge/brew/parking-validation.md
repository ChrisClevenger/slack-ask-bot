1. Park in the garage by pulling a ticket at the gate, as if you were a Corazon retail customer.

2. Bring the ticket in with you.

3. Work your shift.

4. Go to this url: https://104.54.195.116/Olv/Views/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fOlv

6. You will be prompted to login.

          User name: employees
          Password: BrewCrew44

7. After login, click the eParc Val tab.

8. You will be prompted to look up your ticket in the system. Follow the instructions on the screen that show you were to find your ticket number and the time you pulled the ticket.

8. After locating the ticket, look for the drop down menu and select the "Employee/Bulk Parking - 1hr" option.


9. You can adjust the quantity in one-hour increments -- you'll see when you view the system, you add hours to the ticket as if you were ordering multiple quantities of the same item in an online store. (Apparently you can't add an additional 30-minute increment to this, it has to be 1-hour chunks.)

9 You MUST put your full name in the Notes/Memo field.  

10. Complete the psuedo-transaction and look for confirmation that the validation was added to the ticket. 

11. Leave the garage via the exit on the far right. You insert your validated ticket to the box with glowing blue light, and the gate should open for you. 

Note that if you go a single minute over the amount of time validated on the ticket, they charge you the $5 for that next hour, just to get out of the garage.
